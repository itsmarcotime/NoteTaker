# NoteTaker

## this application was built using express, node, and javascript. So far all the html pages are linked together. The user is presened with a home page and can click start to begin taking notes.. however, this is where my appliction breaks down.. so far I am trying to figure out how to save the text a user inputs into the text box. I am able to console.log an undefined response everytime I try to save something but this is as far as I got.. currently turning what I have..
